				<b class="text-purple">To make your journey easier,</b> we recommend you to check the following aspects prior to your trip and once you arrive to your destination:
				<br>
				<br>

				<h5 class="text-purple">Prior to your trip:</h5>
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>Check that your passport and ID documents are up to date.</li>
					<li>If you’re visiting your doctor, make sure your appointments are set and organized.</li>
					<li>Check your hotel reservation and shuttle service if you applied for any.</li>
					<li>If you are driving and crossing into Mexico with your car, make sure your auto insurance covers traveling to Mexico; if it doesn’t, you can buy a 1 day or 1 week insurance in Yuma, AZ (the nearest town to Los Algodones).</li>
					<li>Bring some extra money or a valid credit card (Visa or Mastercard) for precaution.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5 class="text-purple">Once you arrive to your destination:</h5>
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>If you are flying, check your baggage tags to make sure you have the correct luggage.</li>
					<li>If you are driving, make sure to follow the directions to the Andrade Custom Border, this will lead you to Los Algodones.</li>
